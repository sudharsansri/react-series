        <h1>React</h1>
        <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
        <p>It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page.</p>
        <p>Its key feature is the ability to build components that manage their own state.</p>
        <p>React can also be used with other libraries or frameworks, such as Redux for state management.</p>
